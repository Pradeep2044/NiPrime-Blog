            <p>Bangkok, Thailand's vibrant capital, is known for its bustling streets, ornate temples, and diverse cultural attractions. To make the most of a 3-day trip, it’s best to start with the iconic temples and landmarks. On day one, visit the Grand Palace, a majestic complex of buildings that once housed Thai kings. Just next door, you’ll find Wat Phra Kaew, home to the revered Emerald Buddha. Afterward, head to Wat Pho to see the giant reclining Buddha and explore its serene surroundings. In the evening, take a boat ride along the Chao Phraya River to enjoy the city’s skyline.</p>
            <br>
            <p>On day two, dive deeper into Bangkok’s unique markets and local neighborhoods. Start the day by visiting the Chatuchak Weekend Market (if it's a weekend) or the vibrant streets of Yaowarat, Bangkok's Chinatown. These areas offer a sensory overload of food stalls, local products, and street vendors. For a more modern experience, visit the upscale shopping malls like Siam Paragon or CentralWorld. Don’t forget to indulge in Thai street food; try pad Thai, mango sticky rice, and boat noodles.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For day three, focus on experiencing the city's modern attractions while enjoying some relaxation. Begin with a visit to the Jim Thompson House, a traditional Thai house turned museum, showcasing exquisite silk craftsmanship. Then, explore the urban park, Lumpini Park, where you can enjoy a peaceful stroll or rent a paddleboat on the lake. In the evening, visit one of the many rooftop bars to enjoy stunning views of the city while sipping on a cocktail. The Sky Bar at Lebua State Tower offers one of the best panoramic views of the city.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Lastly, Bangkok’s nightlife is unmatched, so be sure to experience the vibrant evening scene. After a day of sightseeing, head to Khao San Road for a lively atmosphere, with an endless array of bars, restaurants, and clubs. Alternatively, visit one of Bangkok’s many night markets, where you can shop for souvenirs and enjoy more street food under the stars. Whether you’re exploring temples or indulging in nightlife, Bangkok offers a perfect mix of culture, history, and modern excitement to fill three unforgettable days.</p>
