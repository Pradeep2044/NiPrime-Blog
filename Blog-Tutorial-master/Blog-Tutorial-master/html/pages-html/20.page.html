            <p>India’s Foreign Secretary at the time, S. Jaishankar, represented the nation at Donald Trump’s swearing-in ceremony as the 45th President of the United States. This marked an important diplomatic gesture, underlining India’s commitment to strengthening its ties with the U.S. The inauguration, held in Washington D.C., attracted global leaders and dignitaries, emphasizing the significance of the U.S. presidency on international relations. By attending the event, India demonstrated its willingness to engage proactively with the Trump administration and build on the bilateral relationship cultivated during the Obama era.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Jaishankar’s presence signaled India’s intention to maintain continuity in its strategic partnership with the United States, especially in areas such as trade, defense, and counterterrorism. The two nations had witnessed a steady growth in cooperation over the previous decade, and India viewed the Trump presidency as an opportunity to deepen collaboration further. His participation also reflected India's respect for U.S. democratic traditions and underscored the importance of diplomacy in managing global partnerships.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The visit also provided Jaishankar an opportunity to engage with members of Trump’s incoming administration. Informal interactions during the inauguration set the stage for future diplomatic talks, particularly on issues like the H-1B visa policy, regional security, and energy cooperation. India was keen on addressing potential challenges and finding areas of mutual interest to enhance bilateral cooperation under the new administration’s policies.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This diplomatic outreach by India at such a high-profile event showcased its recognition of the U.S.’s influence on global matters and its proactive approach to securing India’s interests. As the world watched the transition of power in the United States, India’s presence affirmed its commitment to a strong and evolving partnership, signaling a positive outlook for the future of India-U.S. relations.</p>
